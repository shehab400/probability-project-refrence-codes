## Overview
This project explores the relationship between sleep duration and GPA (Grade Point Average) through data visualization and polynomial regression models. The code demonstrates how sleep habits impact academic performance, providing insights via graphical representations including a polynomial regression curve, histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots.

## Features
1. **Polynomial Regression Analysis:**
   - Models the relationship between sleep duration and GPA.
   - Highlights the optimal sleep duration (7.5 hours) for achieving the highest GPA.
   - Visualized using a regression curve.

2. **Simulated Data Visualizations:**
   - **Histogram:** Shows the distribution of students' nightly sleep durations.
   - **Bar Chart:** Displays the average GPA grouped by sleep duration ranges (<6 hours, 6â€“7 hours, >7 hours).
   - **Scatter Plot:** Illustrates individual GPA data points versus sleep durations with a trend line for better clarity.

3. **Enhanced Annotations:**
   - Markers and annotations emphasize critical points such as the optimal GPA, lowest GPA, and highest GPA.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

Install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or copy the script into your local Python environment.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. The script generates multiple plots:
   - A polynomial regression curve showing the relationship between sleep duration and GPA.
   - A histogram visualizing the distribution of sleep durations.
   - A bar chart grouping average GPA by sleep duration ranges.
   - A scatter plot with individual student data points and a trend line.

## Code Breakdown
### Polynomial Regression
- Simulates a quadratic relationship between sleep hours and GPA.
- Demonstrates the optimal GPA (3.5) achieved with 7.5 hours of sleep.

### Simulated Data Visualizations
- Uses random normal and uniform distributions to simulate realistic student sleep habits and GPA trends.
- Visualizes data using:
  - **Histogram:** Distribution of sleep durations.
  - **Bar Chart:** Average GPA for predefined sleep groups.
  - **Scatter Plot:** Individual data points with annotations for outliers.

### Graphical Enhancements
- Titles, labels, gridlines, and legends for better interpretability.
- Annotations for key points in the scatter plot.

## Output Examples
### Plot 1: Polynomial Regression Curve
Illustrates the optimal sleep duration (7.5 hours) for the highest GPA.

### Plot 2: Histogram
Shows the frequency distribution of sleep durations among students.

### Plot 3: Bar Chart
Compares average GPA values for different sleep duration groups.

### Plot 4: Scatter Plot
Presents individual student GPA data points against their sleep durations, with a trend line for clarity.

## Customization
- Modify the parameters such as sleep ranges, GPA formula, or sample size to tailor the analysis to different scenarios.
- Adjust the visual appearance (colors, labels, etc.) by tweaking the `matplotlib` configurations.
